   <h2> Being ECO Friendly when using personal care products.</h2>

            <p class="issue"> THE BIG ISSUE: Many of the personal products that we use are causing harm to the environment because of the ingredients being used, how the product is being made, and the packaging of the product. In addition, many of these products are not produced with natural ingredients, and are instead made with many chemicals. Products are usally wrapped in plastic which is not good for the environment because plastic can relase harmful chemicals. They affect our environment by making its way through lakes, rivers, and oceans causing pollution which can hurt sea life and eventually us. It isn't healthy for us or the environment. </p>

      <p class="waste"><u>EXCESSIVE WASTE:</u> Every wonder what happens to the leftover soap bars and bottles that you don't use at the hotel? Well obviously, they get thrown out and...they end up in the landfill. However, when it ends up in the landfill, it causes harm to the environment. The shampoo bottles and soap bars often half used or barely used become waste right after they're thrown in the landfill. Because almost every bottle created with plastic, "95% of the plastic used in your hotel room end up in landfill where they sit for hundreds of years" according to <link href="https://www.greengetaways.com.au/green-hospitality-resources/"</link> Plastic waste is a huge problem and it's causing pollution in our environment. In addition to that, this causes higher garbarge removal costs for the hotel and makes environmental standards harder for hotels to meet.</p>
      <p class="unnatural"><u>UNNATURAL INGREDIENTS: </u> A common ingredient found in many personal care products are microbreads. Microbeads are small, tiny plastic particles that are often used in personal care products. These particles are composed of polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polymethlyl methacrylate (PMMA) or nylon. AKA plastic. Microbeads are used in in your body and face washes, but also in toothpaste, sunscreen, lip gloss, eyeliner, shampoo, deodorant, and soaps. Because these beads are so tiny, they can easily be washed down through sinks/bathtubs, soon polluting the ocean. Fish may accidently mistaken it as food and end up eating it. Then, we may end up eating the fish. It could potentially turn into a chain. <a href ="https://www.sgs.com/en/news/2017/10/the-problem-of-microbeads-in-personal-care-products"> Click Here To Learn More</a></p>
      <p class="chemicals"><u>HARMFUL CHEMICALS:</u> Is your sunscreen harming the environment? Sunscreen is slowly killing off coral reefs turning them into "zombie reefs" and it's all because of a certain chemical inside it. According to  oxybenzone is the main ingredient in suncreen that is damaging coral reefs.“[Oxybenzone] causes weird deformities in soft tissue and also causes the coral larvae to encase itself in its own skeleton, in its own coffin,” one of the study’s authors, Craig Downs, P.h.D., told the Guardian. There are also many other chemicals that harm the enivronment.

    <p> * Hotel soap solution: A man named Shawn Spieler has founded a program called Clean the World in which they recycle hotel soap and give it to other people in the world who lack sanitation. Clean the World partners with hotels that give them the soap and with the world Health organization. “Clean the World saves lives with items that traditionally end up in landfills.”<a href = "https://cleantheworld.org/">CLICK HERE FOR THE LINK</a></p>
 <p> * Use zero waste personal care products <a href = "https://thedharmatrails.com/ultimate-guide-to-eco-friendly-toiletries/">CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT MORE</a></p>
<p> * Don’t be fooled by brands that greenwash: ( “Greenwashing is the practice of making an unsubstantiated or misleading claim about the environmental benefits of a product, service, technology or company practice.”) In others words, they are brands that make you think they’re environmental friendly when they’re really not. One example, is Bath and Body Works<a href ="https://organicallybecca.com/top-brands-that-greenwash/">Click here to learn more</a></p>
<p> * Use reusable soap bottles ( can be made out of glass/ metal)</p>
<p> * Use biodegradable soap bars</p>
<p> * Replace items made out of plastic with metal/ glass, compostable paper, recycled plastic, or bamboo. They can all be recycled. Next time, instead of using a plastic toothbrush, use a wooden toothbrush instead.</p>
