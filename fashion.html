      <h2>THE ISSUE</h2>
      <hr>
      <p class="bold"><b>Fast fashion can be defined as cheap, trendy clothing, that samples ideas from the catwalk or celebrity culture and turns them into garments in high street stores at breakneck speed.</b></p>
      <p>Clothing brands such as Forever 21 are involved in the fast fashion industry. There is no secret that their clothing is far from what is considered high-quality. Forever 21 is constantly getting new styles in daily in order to quickly create new products.
        "Because clothing is made in such a rushed manner, brands are selling severely low-quality merchandise.
         There isn’t enough time for a proper quality control or to make sure a shirt has the right amount of buttons when there is such urgency from the brand to get clothing to their crowd of customers."</p>
      <p>"Fast Fashion can impact consumers themselves, encouraging the “throw-away” culture because of both the built-in obsolescence of the products and the speed at which trends are produced.
        Fast Fashion makes us believe we need to shop more and more to stay on top of trends, creating a constant sense of need and ultimate disatisfaction."</p>

      <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Don't worry because <b class="bold">you</b> can help! Here's how: </p>
      <p>"Choosing an eco-friendly fabric is complex as there are pros and cons to all fiber types, but hopefully we have several material guides to help you, such as denim, linen, cotton and more.
        Finally we should Make it Last and wear our clothes until they are worn out, and again we have tons of resources."</p>
      <p>*Not all natural products like cotton are what they seem to be as they can be genetically modified.</p>
      <p>Fabrics such as:
      <li>linen</li>
      <li>bamboo</li>
      <li>hemp</li>
      <li>lyocell</li>
      <li>alpaca</li>
      <li>organic wool</li>
      <li>silk</li><br>
      are all fabrics that are more eco-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>Sustainable clothing brands tend to be quite pricy for many people, but going to second hand stores are eco-conscious as well as budget-conscious.</p>
