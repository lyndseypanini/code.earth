      <h2><u>THE ISSUE</u></h2>
       <div class="paragraph">
        <p> Amazonaws.com states that globally, food worth $750 billion is lost or wasted each year throughout the entire supply chain. Reducing food loss and waste could help to recover these economic losses and reduce financial burdens on the world’s most vulnerable people. In Sub-Saharan Africa, one of the world’s poorest and most food-insecure regions, the World Bank estimates that just a 1 percent reduction in post-harvest losses could lead to economic gains of $40 million each year. And out of that $40 million, most of the benefits would go directly to the smallholder farmers growing the food.</p>
        <h3> According to unilevel.com :</h3>
        <p> ❇ There is more than enough food produced in the world to feed everyone, yet 821 million people go to bed hungry every night. And this number has been increasing since 2015, after having steadily dropped between 2005 and 2015. </p>
        <p> ❇ Around a third of the food produced globally is lost or wasted – that's about 1.3 billion tonnes each year. According to the EAT-Lancet Commission’s January 2019 report, we cannot achieve a sustainable food system without addressing the challenge of food loss and waste.</p>
        <p> ❇ 28% of the world's agricultural area is used annually to produce food that is lost or wasted.</p>
        <p> ❇ Food loss and waste contribute heavily to climate change, making up around 8% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Around 1 billion tonnes of CO2e per year could be avoided if, globally, humanity tackled food loss and waste across the value chain.</p>
        <p> ❇ Food waste costs the global economy around US$940 billion each year. Reducing this waste across the value chain is also a major business opportunity, valued at US$405 billion.</p>
